I am a fourth-year **Ph.D. student** in the University of Science and Technology of China, advised by Prof. [Xiangnan He](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hexn/) and [Fuli Feng](https://fulifeng.github.io/).  Previously, I received my bachelor's degree from the Elite College at Harbin Institute of Technology in 2021. I was awarded the National Scholarship for three consecutive years. Additionally, I won two gold medals in the ACM-ICPC. 


My research interests are in improving the general reasoning abilities of foundational LLMs, and LLMs for recommendation.

- **General Reasoning of Foundational LLMs**: Focusing on enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs during the pre-training phase, including STEM, code, and logical reasoning, as in <b style="color:blue">Qwen2.5 Series, Qwen3 Series, QwQ.</b>

- **LLMs for recommendation**: Exploring the application of LLMs in recommendations, including user modeling and dynamically adapting to users' new interests, as in <b style="color:blue">TallRec, BigRec, $D^3$, RecICL.</b>

- **Scaling Reinforcement Learning**: Automating the scaling of RL question-answer pairs through code-related problems to enhance general reasoning capabilities, as in <b style="color:blue">TeaR.</b>
